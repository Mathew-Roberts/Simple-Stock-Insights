# stocks-visualisations

In this repository, I have conducted some independent research into the stock prices of Exxon Mobil, Oil and Natural Gas. The stock prices have been curated from https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/ - the data is a daily time series and covers the last 5 years. I have stored each stock price time series in respective Pandas dataframes.

I have produced a report exploring the relationships and inter - dependence of the 3 datasets, with some simple visualisations to accompany my explanations. I have also performed extensive research using various literary sources to provide the reader with background as to why the stocks may have behaved/ are behaving in a certain manner.
